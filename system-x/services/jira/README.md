# Where is generated package?

The `software.tnb.jira.validation.generated.*` package is generated by `openapi-generator-maven-plugin` from OpenApi file which is in resources
folder [jira-v3.v3.formatted.json](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fjira-v3.v3.formatted.json).
Thanks to that, we don't need all generated resources (~around 750classes) in the source code repository.
The classes are generated during the compile phase into target/generated-sources.
Due to that, the IDE will show unresolved import errors until you run `mvn clean compile` in the `system-x-jira` package.

# How do I need to use Jira Cloud?

The `validation` has been implemented based on [Jira cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/) creating a base project and adding `Bug` issue type, then updating it adding `Priority` field.

Last update of the openapi file: 2025-09-25 from https://dac-static.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/swagger-v3.v3.json?_v=1.8183.0

Manual changes performed:
  - removed `exclude` property from `ApprovalConfiguration` as it does not conform to the openAPI spec - https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Jira-articles/Generating-a-REST-client-for-Jira-Cloud/bc-p/3072250#M19639 
  - added `untranslatedName` property into `IssueTypeDetails` as it is returned by the API, but not present in the schema - https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/untranslatedname-property-returned-within-the-issue-types-api-response/46934/10
