# Where is generated package?

The `software.tnb.jira.validation.generated.*` package is generated by `openapi-generator-maven-plugin` from OpenApi file which is in resources
folder [jira-v3.v3.formatted.json](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fjira-v3.v3.formatted.json).
Thanks to that, we don't need all generated resources (~around 750classes) in the source code repository.
The classes are generated during the compile phase into target/generated-sources.
Due to that, the IDE will show unresolved import errors until you run `mvn clean compile` in the `system-x-jira` package.
